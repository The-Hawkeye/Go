Clone The Repo


I have used redis as NoSQL for data storage

Created APIS To Enter the Particular game mode , and to leave the game mode

I have created a webhook to get the real-time updates of the number of users in that mode based on the area code 

Once subscribed , Ig there is any change in that area , you will get Real-time updates
